        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>

            <li>1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, or 12 ounces fresh baby spinach</li>

            <li>1 (14-ounce) can or jar artichoke hearts packed in water</li>

            <li>3 medium scallions</li>

            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>

            <li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded (1 cup) and divided</li>

            <li>1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1/4 cup)</li>

            <li>8 ounces cream cheese</li>

            <li>1 cup sour cream (8 ounces)</li>

            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

            <li>Finely grated zest of 1 medium lemon</li>

            <li>Crackers, tortilla chips, baguette slices, crostini, or crudités, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Heat the oven to broil.</strong> Arrange a rack 5 to 6 inches from the broiler element. Heat the oven to broil. Coat an 8x8-inch broiler-safe baking dish with cooking spray.</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the spinach.</strong> If using frozen spinach, place 10 ounces in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 1-minute bursts until defrosted. If using fresh spinach, blanch 12 ounces in a large pot of boiling water until wilted, then drain and rinse with cold water.</li>

            <li><strong>Dry and chop the spinach.</strong> When cool enough to handle, squeeze all the excess moisture from the spinach. If using fresh spinach, coarsely chop it. Place the spinach in a large saucepan.</li>

            <li><strong>Chop the artichokes, scallions, and garlic.</strong> Drain the artichokes and chop into bite-sized pieces. Thinly slice 3 scallions and mince 2 garlic cloves. Add everything to the saucepan.</li>

            <li><strong>Grate the cheeses.</strong> Shred 4 ounces mozzarella cheese (1 cup) and grate 1 ounce Parmesan cheese (1/4 cup). Add the Parmesan and 1/2 cup of the mozzarella to the saucepan.</li>

            <li><strong>Add the creamy ingredients and seasoning.</strong> Cut 8 ounces cream cheese into 8 pieces. Add the cream cheese, 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper to the saucepan.</li>

            <li><strong>Heat until melted and smooth.</strong> Cook the dip over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the cream cheese is melted and the dip is evenly combined and steaming, about 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, finely grate the zest of 1 lemon.</li>

            <li><strong>Cook the dipAdd the lemon zest.</strong> Remove the dip from the heat and stir in the lemon zest.</li>

            <li><strong>Top with more cheese and broil until browned.</strong> Transfer the dip to the baking dish and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Broil until the cheese on top is melted golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve warm with crackers, tortilla chips, baguette slices, crostini, or crudités.</li>
